                ## Grouping Customers by Spending Behavior

                Types of spending behavior:
                * Customerâ€™s total spend
                * Number of purchases
                * Recency of purchases

                A customers **total spend** is the total amount of money spend by the customer at the store. 
                A customer that makes very large purchases is obviously a valuable customer, but if those purchases are very infrequent
                or in the case the customer only made one large purchase, that customer is not as valuable as a customer that makes 
                frequent purchases. That is why spending behavior takes into account the number of purchases a customer makes.

                In this case we will not use the recency of a customer's purchases to evaluate them because of the limited time frame of this dataset.

                The following graph visualizes the relationship between a customer's spend and their purchase frequency. The further right a customer 
                is means they make frequent purchases and the further up they are means they spend more money per purchase. Thus the most valuable customers 
                appear more up and to the right.

            customers buying products. This is the bigger reason that I did not choose recency of purchases to be a feature, because most 
            customers would be considered recent buyers when in reality most of them only came to buy during the end of the year.

            I defined a "seasonal" customer to be one that does 90 percent of their shopping in the last 4 months of the year (Sept-Dec). 
            After splitting the customers into seasonal and non-seasonal customers, I broke down those groups by customer value and found 
            that almost all of the seasonal customers are low value customers. This makes sense because low value customers buy less frequently
            and if they are making 90 percent of their purchases at the end of the year they are not likely to be purchasing frequently relative 
            to customers that make purchases all year.

            The store can focus on retaining its high value and mid value customers.

            The store could promote holidays or events outside of the end of year season to low-value, seasonal, customers. This could lead 
            to them purchasing more frequently and becoming mid-value customers.

            Lastly, The store could have weekend promotions to encourage customers to shop on friday or Sunday since those are the days when the 
            customers shop the least.
