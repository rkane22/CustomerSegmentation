                                    A customers **total spend** is the total amount of money spend by the customer at the store. 
                                    A customer that makes very large purchases is obviously a valuable customer, but if those purchases are very infrequent
                                    or in the case the customer only made one large purchase, that customer is not as valuable as a customer that makes 
                                    frequent purchases. That is why spending behavior takes into account the number of purchases a customer makes.
                                    <br>
                                    In this case we will not use the recency of a customer's purchases to evaluate them because of the limited time frame of this dataset.
                                    <br>
                                    The following graph visualizes the relationship between a customer's spend and their purchase frequency. The further right a customer 
                                    is means they make frequent purchases and the further up they are means they spend more money per purchase. Thus the most valuable customers 
                                    appear more up and to the right.

                                    The 80/20 rule is a common rule applied to the topic of customer segmentation. It means that the top 20 percent of customers 
                                    (by total money spent) account for 80 percent of all revenue. I applied it to this dataset and found it very close to true.

                                This dataset only contains purchases made in 2011, but it covers the entire year. I noticed that there were more customers 
                                shopping at the end of the year than any other time. There is a seasonal bump from september to December in the total number of
                                customers buying products. This is the bigger reason that I did not choose recency of purchases to be a feature, because most 
                                customers would be considered recent buyers when in reality most of them only came to buy during the end of the year.

                                    I used KMeans clustering to group the customers into teirs of value. I used what is called the "elbow method" to determine the optimal
                                    number for k. The elbow method is simply to graph the SSE for each k which produces a line that looks somewhat like an arm, and pick the k
                                    that would be the elbow for that arm. In this case k = 3 was the best value.

                                I defined a "seasonal" customer to be one that does 90 percent of their shopping in the last 4 months of the year (Sept-Dec). 
                                After splitting the customers into seasonal and non-seasonal customers, I broke down those groups by customer value and found 
                                that almost all of the seasonal customers are low value customers. This makes sense because low value customers buy less frequently
                                and if they are making 90 percent of their purchases at the end of the year they are not likely to be purchasing frequently relative 
                                to customers that make purchases all year.

                                I defined a customers "favourite" day by the day in which the customer made the most purchases out of the week. The reasoning behind this 
                                is that it would probably be the customer's most likely day to shop in he future. I then broke down the customers by value on each of their 
                                favourite days. There is a bump on thursdays in high value customers over the other days, and customers of all types shop less on friday 
                                and sunday.

                                The store can focus on retaining its high value and mid value customers. They are
                                the most valuable as they spend more money and they spend more often so a goal of the 
                                store should be to keep their spending at this level.

                                The store could promote holidays or events outside of the end of year season to low-value, seasonal, customers. Since a large 
                                amount of low value customers are considered just seasonal customers, if the store could
                                get them to shop at other times of the year it would lead to them spending more frequently
                                and move them in the direction of mid-value customers.

                                Lastly, The store could have weekend promotions to encourage customers to shop on friday or Sunday since most customers 
                                do not make most of their purchases those days. This could lead to all customers spending more frequently in the week and 
                                spending more overall.
